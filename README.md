Project Description: Online Voting System using PHP and MySQL

The Online Voting System is a web-based application developed to modernize and digitize the process of elections. Built using PHP for backend scripting and MySQL for database management, the system allows registered voters to cast their votes securely via a simple web interface. It was designed with a focus on usability, data integrity, and transparency of results.

This project features a responsive front-end interface created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports voter registration, candidate management, and vote casting. The system ensures one-person-one-vote by validating voter identity and preventing duplicate voting entries. A real-time graphical representation of the voting results is provided using Chart.js, with interactive features such as toggle buttons to switch between bar and pie chart views.

On the database side, the project incorporates various SQL commands and DBMS operations such as:

DDL (Data Definition Language): Used to create tables for voters, candidates, and votes.

DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used to insert and manage voting data.

DCL (Data Control Language): Used to manage privileges and restrict unauthorized data access.

TCL (Transaction Control Language): Implemented to handle safe and consistent data updates using commit and rollback.

Key functionalities include:

Voter registration with validation of name, voter ID, and gender.

Admin access to manage candidates and monitor votes.

Vote submission with confirmation and success alert.

Real-time result visualization using interactive charts.

Clean and modern UI with no auto-refresh for better performance.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical use of full-stack web development and database management concepts. It also offers a scalable foundation for deploying a larger, more secure online election system in real-life scenarios.
